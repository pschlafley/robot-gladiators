// Game States
// "WIN" - Player robot has defeated all enemy robots
//      * Fight all enemy robots
//      * Defeat each enemy robot
// "LOSE" - Player robot's health is zero or less

// Wrap the game logic in a startGame() function
// When a the player is defeated or there are no more enemies, call an endGame() function that:
// * Alerts the player's total stats
// * Asks the player if they want to play again
// * if yes, call the startGame() to restart the game

// After the player skips or defeats an enemy (and there are still more robots to fight):
// * Ask the player if they want to "shop"
// * if no, continue as normal
// * if yes, call the shop() function
// * in the shop() function, as player if they want to "refill" health, "upgrade" attack, or "leave" the shop
// * if refill, subtract money points from player and increase health
// * if upgrade, subtract money points from player and increase attack power
// * if leave, alert goodbye and exit the function
// * if any other invalid option, call shop() again

//you can also log multible values at once like this
